E-commerce Application built with the MEAN stack

We are using this applcation to create our own custom product and use it for a cause.

This e-commerce platform is actually built by the original person step-by-step on his book "Building an e-Commerce Application with MEAN" available on [Amazon] (http://www.amazon.com/Building-e-Commerce-Application-Adrian-Mejia/dp/1785286552/) and [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/building-e-commerce-application-mean).
